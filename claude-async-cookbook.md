## Bonus: Orchestration Patterns

### Complex Pipeline Orchestrator

Combine multiple recipes into complex pipelines.

```bash
# 🚀 Startup MVP Orchestrator Function
# This function orchestrates the complete generation of a startup MVP by combining multiple recipes
# Creates a production-ready application with all necessary components in a structured pipeline
orchestrate_startup_mvp() {
    local startup_name="$1"                       # 🏢 Name of the startup for branding and naming
    local mvp_type="$2"                          # 📱 Type of MVP: saas, marketplace, social
    
    echo "🚀 Orchestrating complete MVP for $startup_name..."

    generate_db_migrations                         # 🗃️ Database migration scripts and tools
    wait_for_claude_jobs                          # ⏳ Wait for foundation before proceeding

    # Create the core application components and business logic
    echo "Phase 2: Core development..."
    generate_microservices "$startup_name"        # 🏗️ Microservices architecture
    generate_graphql_api "$mvp_type"             # 🔗 GraphQL API for flexible data access
    generate_ecommerce_platform "$startup_name" "Next.js + Stripe + PostgreSQL"  # 🛒 E-commerce functionality
    wait_for_claude_jobs                          # ⏳ Wait for core development
    
    # 🛡️ Phase 3: Quality & Security (15 min)

    generate_test_pyramid "./src" "Full Stack"    # 🧪 Complete testing suite
    generate_security_suite "web"                 # 🔒 Security scanning and compliance
    generate_load_tests "api-spec.yaml"          # ⚡ Performance and load testing
    wait_for_claude_jobs                          # ⏳ Wait for quality assurance
    
    # 📚 Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment (10 min)

    echo "Phase 4: Documentation and deployment..."
    generate_multi_format_docs "./src" "$startup_name"  # 📖 Comprehensive documentation
    generate_multi_language_sdks "api-spec.yaml"        # 🔧 SDKs for multiple languages
    wait_for_claude_jobs                                  # ⏳ Wait for documentation
    
    # 📊 Phase 5: Monitoring & Analytics (10 min)
    # Set up monitoring, logging, and analytics for production operations
    echo "Phase 5: Setting up monitoring..."
    run_claude_parallel \
        "Create comprehensive monitoring stack with Grafana dashboards" \  # 📈 Visual monitoring dashboards
        "Create log aggregation with ELK stack" \                         # 📝 Centralized logging system

        "Create SRE runbooks and incident response"                        # 📋 Operational procedures
    
    wait_for_claude_jobs                          # ⏳ Wait for monitoring setup
    
    echo "✅ MVP for $startup_name completed in ~70 minutes!"
    echo "Generated: Infrastructure, APIs, Frontend, Tests, Security, Docs, and Monitoring"
}

# 🚀 Usage Example
# This example shows how to generate a complete marketplace MVP
# Replace "TechStartup" with your startup name and "marketplace" with your MVP type
orchestrate_startup_mvp "TechStartup" "marketplace"
```

## Tips for Using the Cookbook

1. **Start Small**: Begin with individual recipes before combining them
2. **Monitor Resources**: Watch system resources when running large batches
3. **Customize Prompts**: Modify prompts to match your specific needs
4. **Use Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for long-running tasks
5. **Save Outputs**: Organize generated code in a structured directory
6. **Version Control**: Commit generated code to track changes
7. **Review Generated Code**: Always review and test generated code
8. **Iterate**: Use generated code as a starting point and refine

## Contributing Your Own Recipes

To add your own recipes to this cookbook:

1. Identify repetitive coding tasks that could benefit from parallelization
2. Break down the task into independent components
3. Write clear, specific prompts for each component
4. Test the recipe with different parameters
5. Document the recipe with clear usage examples

Remember: The power of parallel code generation lies in identifying tasks that can be split into independent units. Look for opportunities where multiple similar components need to be created, or where different aspects of a system can be developed simultaneously.
